  **We will address these one-by-one currently**
  
  üîç Critical Issues

  1. Memory Safety Concerns

  - Header Validation: Header::validate() uses positive dimension checks but allows negative mode values (should use matches! with unsigned comparison)
  - Unsafe Operations: Multiple unsafe blocks in mrcfile.rs for header/data reading without proper validation
  - Memory Leaks: Box::leak() usage in MrcFile::read_view() and MrcMmap::open() creates permanent memory leaks

  2. Endian Handling Issues

  - Missing Packed4Bit Support: MrcViewMut::swap_endian_bytes() doesn't handle Packed4Bit mode (mode 101)
  - Machine Stamp Swapping: The machine stamp swapping in Header::swap_endian() may not be correct for all platforms

  3. Error Handling Gaps

  - Generic Error Types: Error::Io is too generic - should provide more specific error information
  - Missing Validation: No validation for extended header size bounds (could overflow)

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate Issues

  4. API Design Problems

  - Inconsistent Naming: MrcViewMut::write_ext_header() vs MrcFile::write_ext_header() have different signatures
  - Missing Features: No support for updating header statistics (dmin, dmax, dmean, rms)
  - Limited Metadata: No convenience methods for common operations like getting voxel spacing

  5. Performance Optimizations

  - Unnecessary Allocations: MrcFile::create() allocates zero-filled vector for extended header
  - Inefficient Reading: MrcFile::read_view() reads entire file into memory instead of streaming

  6. Testing Gaps

  - Missing Edge Cases: No tests for maximum dimension values or overflow scenarios
  - No Benchmark Tests: Missing performance benchmarks for large files
  - Limited Negative Tests: Insufficient testing of error conditions

  üìã Specific Recommendations

  Immediate Fixes

  1. Fix memory leaks by returning owned data instead of leaking
  2. Add bounds checking for extended header size
  3. Improve error messages with more context
  4. Add Packed4Bit support to endian swapping

  Enhancement Opportunities

  1. Add convenience methods:
    - voxel_size() returning (x,y,z) spacing
    - physical_dimensions() returning physical size
    - update_statistics() for auto-calculating min/max/mean/rms
  2. Improve API consistency:
    - Rename MrcViewMut::write_ext_header() to write_extended_header()
    - Add MrcView::extended_header() as alias
  3. Add validation:
    - Extended header size limits
    - Dimension bounds checking
    - Mode-specific validation

  Code Quality Improvements

  1. Add documentation examples for common use cases
  2. Improve error variants with more specific types
  3. Add feature flags for additional validation
  4. Implement proper error handling for I/O operations

  Safety Improvements

  1. Replace unsafe blocks with safe alternatives where possible
  2. Add debug assertions for array bounds
  3. Use checked arithmetic for size calculations
  4. Add overflow protection for large files

  üéØ Priority Order

  1. High: Fix memory safety issues and memory leaks
  2. High: Improve error handling and validation
  3. Medium: Add missing mode support and convenience methods
  4. Low: Performance optimizations and additional testing
